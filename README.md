# Vector-Autoregressions

More tha four decades ago, Christopher Sims (1980) provided a new macroeconometric framework that held great promise: vector autoregressions (VARs). A VAR is an
n-equation, n-variable linear model in which each variable is in turn explained by its own lagged values, plus current and past values of the remaining n-1 variables.

In this project, we attempt to theoreticaly describe and empirically test how well VAR models can adress four major macroeconomic tasks: data description, forecasting, structural inference and policy analysis. The VAR model selected as well as the theoretical stracture of the project is primarily based on an influential paper in the field, Stock, Watson (2001).
