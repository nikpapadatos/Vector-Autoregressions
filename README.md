# Vector-Autoregressions

## Project Overview
More than four decades ago, Christopher Sims (1980) introduced a groundbreaking macroeconometric framework: vector autoregressions (VARs). A VAR is an n-equation, n-variable linear model where each variable is explained by its own lagged values, alongside the current and past values of the remaining n-1 variables.

In this project, we aim to both theoretically describe and empirically evaluate the effectiveness of VAR models in addressing four key macroeconomic tasks: data description, forecasting, structural inference, and policy analysis. The VAR model selected and the theoretical framework of this study are primarily informed by the influential work of Stock and Watson (2001), which remains a cornerstone in the field.
